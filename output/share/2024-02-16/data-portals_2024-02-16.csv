Many of the newly discovered expressed fragments were verified by RNA blot analysis and a novel technique called differential hybridization mapping (DHM). Interestingly, a significant fraction of these novel fragments are expressed antisense to previously annotated introns. The coding potential of these novel expressed regions is supported by their sequence conservation in the mouse genome.

It includes five major modules, which are: Phenotype, Haplotype, SNP & InDel, Restore Sequence, and Germplasm. Their functions are described with the embedded 3K-RG data as example. Four tips of iceberg for user cases of RFGB v2.0 with corresponding technical routes were presented including: 1) exploring favorable donors for higher zinc concentration in milled grains, 2) shortlisting candidate genes for grain length with near isogenic lines, 3) mining favorable haplotypes for seedling vigor traits under paddy direct seeding system, and 4) variations and restore sequence seeking for a leaf rolling QTL region. RFGB v2.0 has offered a unique view on the relationships between the two big datasets of genome and phenome from 3000-rice, which will spark more ideas on deeper mining of complex traits in rice.

It also provides a readily available source of data for fast validation of experimental results and for exploratory analyses. Finally, it is a shared resource that can be used to foster large-scale collaborations in sleep study.
MASS is composed of cohorts themselves comprising subsets. Recordings within subsets is kept as homogeneous as possible, whereas it is more heterogeneous between subsets. To allow inter-study comparisons, researchers validating their results on MASS are encouraged to specify which portion of the database they used in their assessment (e.g., MASS-C1 for the whole cohort 1, MASS-C1/SS1-SS3 for subsets 1, 2 and 3 of cohort 1).",http://www.ceams-carsm.ca/en/MASS,2014.0,Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine,"Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, Montreal Sacred Heart Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada",,,Canada,,Christian O'Reilly,m-charron@crhsc.rtss.qc.ca,1.0,,9.0,42.0,$2a$10$8PbO5sorE7nvXcoJabMroO5I8DDbcjo9gUUNlBD5SbizXPbiaSMjq,1544146462812.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1517152832000.0,2023-03-03 10:14:20,Other,Literature,sleep,Animal,Homo sapiens,,4.66667,2014.0,,2022-12-04 00:01:44,1.0

It can be very difficult for a scientist who is not trained in structural bioinformatics to access this information comprehensively. Previously, we developed the Protein Common Interface Database (ProtCID), which provided clusters of the interfaces of full-length protein chains as a means of identifying biological assemblies. Because proteins consist of domains that act as modular functional units, we have extended the analysis in ProtCID to the individual domain level. This has greatly increased the number of large protein-protein clusters in ProtCID, enabling the generation of hypotheses on the structures of biological assemblies of many systems. The analysis of domain families allows us to extend ProtCID to the interactions of domains with peptides, nucleic acids, and ligands.

Two criteria have to be met for entering WallProtDB. First one is related to the identification of proteins. Only proteins identified in plant with available genomic or ESTs data are considered to ensure unambiguous identification. Second criterion is related to the difficulty to obtain clean cell wall fractions. Indeed, since cell walls constitute an open compartment difficult to isolate, numerous proteins predicted to be intracellular and/or having functions inside the cell have been identified in cell wall extracts. Then, except proteins predicted to be plasma membrane proteins, only proteins having a predicted signal peptide and no known intracellular retention signal are included in the database. In addition, WallProtDB contains information about the strategies used to obtain cell wall protein extracts and to identify proteins by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Mass spectrometry data are included when available. All the proteins of WallProtDB are linked to ProtAnnDB, another database, which contains structural and functional bioinformatics annotations of proteins as well as links to other databases (Aramemnon, CAZy, Planet, Phytozome, UniProt).

Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA, Kjer type, MIM#165500) is characterized by moderate to severe loss of visual acuity with insidious onset in early childhood, blue-yellow dyschromatopsia and central scotoma. Mutations in the optic atrophy 1 gene (OPA1; MIM#605290) are responsible for about 60-80% of the cases of DOA. The spectrum of OPA1-related disorders is highly variable. The age of onset varies from birth to over 60 years, and the severity of the visual loss ranges from subclinical loss to severe blindness. Estimated disease prevalence is between 1:10,000 in Denmark due to a founder effect and 1:35,000 worldwide. Extra ocular features, involving the central, peripheral and autonomous nervous systems, complicating the optic neuropathy are reported in about 20% of the patients carrying OPA1 pathogenic variants, leading to conditions described as the ""DOA plus"" or ""DOA+"" syndromes (MIM#125250). A phenotype fully compatible with the Behr syndrome (MIM#210000), associating early onset and severe optic neuropathy with spinocerebellar ataxia and retarded development was also reported. This variety of phenotypes is attributed to differences in the OPA1 mutations effects (haplo-insufficiency or dominant negative effect), as well as to the mode of inheritance, which may be mono- or more rarely bi-allelic.",http://mitodyn.org/home.php?select_db=OPA1,2015.0,Angers University,"Angers, France.",Angers,,France,v2.0,Marc FERRE,marc.ferre@univ-angers.fr,1.0,2015-01-01,8.0,28.0,$2a$10$XqjoENX2yVBGz/gb8ubIBusAfM4teSPxQW9IJbIK5bHVMsVonZmoy,1543975623449.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1435652169000.0,2023-03-03 10:10:56,"DNA, RNA, Protein",Health and medicine,OPA1,Animal,Homo sapiens,,3.5,0.0,,2022-12-04 00:00:30,0.0

These studies usually compare the genetic variation between two groups to single out certain Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are linked to a phenotypic variation in one of the groups. However, it is necessary to have a large enough sample size to find statistically significant correlations. Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing can supply additional data: DTC-companies offer the analysis of a large amount of SNPs for an individual at low cost without the need to consult a physician or geneticist. Over 100,000 people have already been genotyped through Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing companies. However, this data is not public for a variety of reasons and thus cannot be used in research. It seems reasonable to create a central open data repository for such data. Here we present the web platform openSNP, an open database which allows participants of Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing to publish their genetic data at no cost along with phenotypic information.

Recent studies of tomato fruit suggest that these traits are influenced by the expression of genes that are associated with cuticle metabolism. However, studies of these phenomena in mango fruit are limited by the lack of genome-scale data. In order to gain insight into the mango cuticle biogenesis and identify putative cuticle-associated genes, we analyzed the transcriptomes of peels from ripe and overripe mango fruit using RNA-Seq.

In order to establish the relevance of associated loci, these are subsequently followed up in available cohorts of brain tissue.

However, these tools are separately available in different online websites or databases, making it challenging for general clinicians, geneticists and biologists to obtain the first-hand information regarding some particular variants and genes of interest. Starting with coding regions and splice sties, we artificially generated all possible single nucleotide variants (n = 110 154 363) and cataloged all reported insertion and deletions (n = 1 223 370). We then annotated these variants with respect to functional consequences from more than 60 genomic data sources to develop a database, named VarCards (http://varcards.biols.ac.cn/), by which users can conveniently search, browse and annotate the variant- and gene-level implications of given variants, including the following information: (i) functional effects; (ii) functional consequences through different in silico algorithms; (iii) allele frequencies in different populations; (iv) disease- and phenotype-related knowledge; (v) general meaningful gene-level information; and (vi) drug-gene interactions. As a case study, we successfully employed VarCards in interpretation of de novo mutations in autism spectrum disorders.

To systematically prioritize the oncogenic ability of somatic mutations and cancer genes, we constructed a useful platform, OncoVar (https://oncovar.org/), which employed published bioinformatics algorithms and incorporated known driver events to identify driver mutations and driver genes. We identified 20 162 cancer driver mutations, 814 driver genes and 2360 pathogenic pathways with high-confidence by reanalyzing 10 769 exomes from 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 1942 genomes from 18 cancer types in International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). OncoVar provides four points of view, ‘Mutation’, ‘Gene’, ‘Pathway’ and ‘Cancer’, to help researchers to visualize the relationships between cancers and driver variants. Importantly, identification of actionable driver alterations provides promising druggable targets and repurposing opportunities of combinational therapies. OncoVar provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading somatic driver mutations, driver genes and pathogenic pathways in various cancer types. This platform will facilitate the identification of cancer drivers across individual cancer cohorts and helps to rank mutations or genes for better decision-making among clinical oncologists, cancer researchers and the broad scientific community interested in cancer precision medicine.",https://oncovar.org/,2021.0,Peking University Third Hospital,,Beijing,Beijing,China,V1,Fengbiao Mao,maofengbiao@126.com,1.0,2020,2.0,28.0,,,0.0,maofengbiao@126.com,0.0,,maofengbiao@126.com,0.0,,1612492784000.0,2023-03-03 10:17:27,DNA,"Genotype phenotype and variation, Health and medicine","driver genes, oncogenic pathways, driver mutation",Animal,human,,14.0,0.0,,2022-12-04 00:02:48,0.0

There are 3 major interaction types in an interactome: microbiome-DME interaction (MICBIO), xenobiotics-DME interaction (XEOTIC), and host protein-DME interaction (HOSPPI). The interaction data of each type are essential for drug metabolism, and the collective consideration of multiple types has implication for the future practice of precision medicine. However, no database was designed to systematically provide the data of all types of DME interactions. Here, a database of the Interactome of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes (INTEDE) was therefore constructed to offer these interaction data. First, 1,047 unique DMEs (448 host and 599 microbial) were confirmed, for the first time, using their metabolizing drugs. Second, for these newly confirmed DMEs, all types of their interactions (3,359 MICBIOs between 225 microbial species and 185 DMEs; 47,778 XEOTICs between 4,150 xenobiotics and 501 DMEs; 7,849 HOSPPIs between 565 human proteins and 566 DMEs) were comprehensively collected and then provided, which enabled the crosstalk analysis among multiple types.

The project was based on LC-MS/MS by utilizing of high resolution and high accuracy Fourier transform mass spectrometry. All mass spectrometry data including precursors and HCD-derived fragments were acquired on the Orbitrap mass analyzers in the high-high mode. Currently, the HPM contains direct evidence of translation of a number of protein products derived from over 17,000 human genes covering >84% of the annotated protein-coding genes in humans based on >290,000 non-redundant peptide identifications of multiple organs/tissues and cell types from individuals with clinically defined healthy tissues.
