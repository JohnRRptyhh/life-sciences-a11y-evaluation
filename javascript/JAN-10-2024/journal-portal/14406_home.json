Accepted manuscripts will be copyedited for style and grammar. \\n\\n## Author responsibilities\\n\\n**Protection of human rights**\\nAuthors of research-based papers are required to show evidence of Ethics approval for their research from a recognised tertiary institution ethics committee (health facility and/ or University). This should include how informed consent to participate was obtained, how privacy, anonymity and confidentiality was protected.  \\n\\nPreparation of manuscript Information regarding authorship should be attached in a covering letter: author(s) name(s); academic qualifications; job titles and affiliations; biographical note in two or three sentences; and the name of the institution or setting where the work was done.\\n\\nArticles of fewer than 5000 words have the best chance of publication. \\n\\nThe de-identified manuscript must be typed with double spacing and all pages and lines should be numbered in a MS Word document. The abstract should be no longer than 200 words and include the aim of the study, its design, setting, participants, key findings, conclusions and future implications.A separate front page should include the title of the paper and the author(s) name(s) with up to four academic qualifications. \\n\\n‘Breastfeeding’ and ‘breastmilk’ are printed in this journal as single words. Authors are asked to distinguish between exclusive and partial breastfeeding and follow definitions outlined by the World Health Organization .\\n\\nBreastfeeding Review expects that breastfeeding be presented as the standard for infant health and nutrition and that artificial-feeding has risks/disadvantages rather than breastfeeding having benefits/advantages.\\nSupplementary material may be added without specific page limits. The readability of the article, however, must not depend upon access to supplementary materials.\\n\\n**Clear science writing**\\nUse the active voice as much as possible. The active voice, where the subject of the verb undertakes the action (e.g. ‘explored’), injects life and clarity into the text whereas the passive voice is less direct (e.g. ‘was explored’) and may cause ambiguity.\\n\\nUse the passive voice when the subject is unknown or when you want to focus on the action or the recipient of the action. Passive voice is often suitable for the Methods section.\\n\\n**File type**\\nWord documents are the preferred format (.doc or .docx) Page numbers and line numbers should be included in the deidentified document for the convenience of the peer-reviewers and the provision of feedback/ recommendations to the author(s)..\\n\\nThe Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (6th ed.) provides helpful guidelines on careful sentence construction and grammar.\\n\\n**Title page**\\n* Title — short and informative (abbreviations should not be used in title)\\n* Running head — short title of 30 characters and spaces\\n* Authors — list all authors by first name, all initials, last name and qualifications\\n* Address of all institutions where the work was done — list departmental affiliations of each author after each institutional address. Connect authors to departments using numbered superscripts\\n* Corresponding author — provide the name, postal address with postal code, telephone number and email address of the author to whom communications, proofs, and requests for reprints should be sent\\n* Word count — state the word count, excluding the Abstract, References, Tables and Figures.\\n\\n**Abstract**\\nThe structured abstract should be no longer than 200 words and should include (without headings): aim, methods, key findings, conclusions. Avoid acronyms and references.\\n\\n**Keywords** \\nUp to five key words or short phrases that will assist indexers in cross indexing the article should be provided. Suitable terms can be obtained from the medical subject headings (MeSH) list of Index Medicus\\n\\n**Main text**\\nText should be organised as follows:\\n\\nIntroduction (including hypothesis or guiding question and outline of the paper)\\n\\nLiterature review (critical but brief review of directly related literature)\\n\\n_Methods_ \\nThe ethical guidelines that were followed by the investigators must be included in the Methods section of the manuscript. State clearly that the subject(s) gave informed consent. Anonymity should be preserved.\\nThe role(s) of the funding organisation, if any, in the collection of data, its analysis and interpretation and in the right to approve or disapprove publication of the finished manuscript must be described in the Methods section of the text.\\n\\n*Results* \\nQuantitative research results should be concisely reported in tables and figures, with brief text descriptions. For qualitative research a balance must be struck between conciseness and sufficient data to support the discussion and conclusion. There should be no discussion of results in the Results section.\\nMeasurements and weights should be given in standard metric units.\\nCite illustrations, figures, graphs and tables in numeric order by order of mention in the text.\\n\\nDiscussion (clear and concise interpretation of results)\\n\\nConclusion (summarise key points)\\n\\n*Acknowledgments and disclosures* \\nGrants, financial support and technical or other assistance are acknowledged at the end of the text before the references. All financial support for the project must be acknowledged. If there has been no financial assistance with the project, this must be clearly stated.\\n\\n*Conflict of interest*\\nAuthors are required to provide a declaration of any conflict of interest, including financial, professional and/ or personal. Where no author contributing to the manuscript has a conflict, a clear statement to that effect is required.\\n\\n*References* \\nThe referencing style for Breastfeeding Review follows the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.). Authors should maintain a balance between ease of reading and the need to cite authorities. Accuracy of the references is the responsibility of the author.\\n\\nExamples of end list references:\\nAustralian Breastfeeding Association. (2015). Vision &amp; mission.
