Query tools allow navigation of FlyBase through DNA or protein sequence, by gene or mutant name, or through terms from the several ontologies used to capture functional, phenotypic, and anatomical data. The database offers several different query tools in order to provide efficient access to the data available and facilitate the discovery of significant relationships within the database. Links between FlyBase and external databases, such as BDGP or modENCODE, provide opportunities for further exploration into other model organism databases and other resources of biological and molecular information.The FlyBase project is carried out by a consortium of Drosophila researchers and computer scientists at Harvard University and Indiana University in the United States, and University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.","http://flybase.org/submission/publication/","http://flybase.org/cgi-bin/qbgui.fr.html","Behavioral and social sciences, Computational biology, Neuroscience, Sequence biology","open","non-human","true","true","undefined","true","true"
